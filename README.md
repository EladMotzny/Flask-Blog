# Flask-Blog

This is a Fullstack blog project I made using Flask for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend.

Make sure you have flask and flask-sqlalchemy installed on your environment like so:

```
$ pip install Flask
$ pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```

To run simply type in the console:
```
python app.py
```

And in your browser go to http://localhost:5000/
